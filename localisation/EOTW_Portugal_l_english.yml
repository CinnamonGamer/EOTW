portugal.1.t:0 "Lusitanian History" 
portugal.1.d:0 "Deus, Patria, Rei. Those 3 words once defined the kingdom of Portugal, a once great economic and military power. Our Colonial Empire was once the second largest in the world and spanned from the far east to the New World. Using African slavery to our advantage to use cheap labour to exploit our colonies’ vast wealth we prospered. Our Monarchs were absolute. Our people were loyal. Then Napoleon came. When Portugal lost the peninsular war, Lisbon was shattered. The old city was captured, and the traitorous monarchs fled, they took our african colonies and our treasures along with our most prosperous colony, Brazil, and in the same time shattered our colonial Empire. In their place, the Kingdom of Lusitania was established. And today, the old humiliation we suffered will be avenged!"

Butin the same time, the governement forgot that those youngs would become father and mother. "the new portuguese generation of 1840", as it was once called, grew in poverty. And thus, they were attracted by those dangerous socialist ideals. And their children were gaven this socialist education, the results are devastatrous. A new entire generation is now constantly rebelling against the governement, refusing to enlist in the army, and even worst, refusing to work in the factories. If this problem isn't resolved, the head of the king will fall..."
