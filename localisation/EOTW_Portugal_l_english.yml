portugal.1.t:0 "Lusitanian History" 
portugal.1.d:0 "Deus, Patria, Rei. Those 3 words once defined the kingdom of Portugal, a once great economic and military power. Our Colonial Empire was once the second largest in the world and spanned from the far east to the New World. Using African slavery to our advantage to use cheap labour to exploit our colonies’ vast wealth we prospered. Our Monarchs were absolute. Our people were loyal. Then Napoleon came. When Portugal lost the peninsular war, Lisbon was shattered. The old city was captured, and the traitorous monarchs fled, they took our african colonies and our treasures along with our most prosperous colony, Brazil, and in the same time shattered our colonial Empire. In their place, the Kingdom of Lusitania was established. And today, the old humiliation we suffered will be avenged!"

portugal.2.d:0 "After the old monarchy fleed to Brazil. Portugal was devastated, thousands of people died because of the devastation, but the governement had a genius idea : "Encouraging the birthrate to grow", and indeed, the plan worked. In a hundred year, the portuguese population almost Quadrupled from size. Permitting an enormous benefice, due to those youngs working in the factories. Butin the same time, the governement forgot that those youngs would become father and mother. "the new portuguese generation of 1840", as it was once called, grew in poverty. And thus, they were attracted by those dangerous socialist ideals. And their children were gaven this socialist education, the results are devastatrous. A new entire generation is now constantly rebelling against the governement, refusing to enlist in the army, and even worst, refusing to work in the factories. If this problem isn't resolved, the head of the king will fall..."

portugal.4.t:0 "The new governement" 
portugal.4.d:0 "The assasination of the prime minister left a great void inside of portuguese politics, after the political purge of autumn 1927 and the dismantlement of the liberals, socialist and communist parties, the "Partido Monarquista Nacional" finnaly asserted her control over portuguese politics, at a great cost hoewever, the little elit was so powerfull that nobody could expect a fonctionning governement without them, this has left Duarte II with an embarassing choice. Either he could find another miguelist puppet to continue his control over the state and his subjects, or he could disband parliament and invite the infamous Francisco Rolão Preto and his clique of integralist collaborators, and if succesfull, begining the creation of a new portugal centered around deus, patria y rei. Óscar Carmona, a friend of our king also proposed a military dictature until the situation with the Brazilian traitor stabilize, while this option would make the king weaker, it also means securing the military. My dear majesty, you need to make a choice."
