portugal.1.t:0 "Lusitanian History" 
portugal.1.d:0 "Deus, Patria, Rei. Those 3 words once defined the kingdom of Portugal, a once great economic and military power. Our Colonial Empire was once the second largest in the world and spanned from the far east to the New World. Using African slavery to our advantage to use cheap labour to exploit our colonies’ vast wealth we prospered. Our Monarchs were absolute. Our people were loyal. Then Napoleon came. When Portugal lost the peninsular war, Lisbon was shattered. The old city was captured, and the traitorous monarchs fled, they took our african colonies and our treasures along with our most prosperous colony, Brazil, and in the same time shattered our colonial Empire. In their place, the Kingdom of Lusitania was established. And today, the old humiliation we suffered will be avenged!"

portugal.2.t:0 "Problems with the youth"
portugal.2.d:0 "After the old monarchy fleed to Brazil. Portugal was devastated, thousands of people died because of the devastation, but the governement had a genius idea : "Encouraging the birthrate to grow", and indeed, the plan worked. In a hundred year, the portuguese population almost Quadrupled from size. Permitting an enormous benefice, due to those youngs working in the factories. Butin the same time, the governement forgot that those youngs would become father and mother. "the new portuguese generation of 1850", as it was once called, grew in poverty. And thus, they were attracted by those dangerous socialist ideals. And their children were gaven this socialist education, the results are devastatrous. A new entire generation is now constantly rebelling against the governement, refusing to enlist in the army, and even worst, refusing to work in the factories. If this problem isn't resolved, the head of the king will fall..."
portugal.2.a:0 "This problem must be resolved with caution"

portugal.3.t:0 "A day in february..." 
portugal.3.d:0 "In a chocking move today, Mr.Sidónio Pais, the prime minister and political protégé of his majesty Duarte II was assasinated during a meeting with his feelow friend of the "Partido Monarquista Nacional", witnesses said that 6 armed civilians quickly entered the building, after 2 minutes, shots were heard from the building, finnaly, the 6 young assassins quickly escaped before the police could intervene. It seems that in just one afternoon, the entire portugese governement was almost decapitated. State funerals will be organised, but for now, Duarte II must make a decision..." 
portugal.3.a:0 "Find them all !" 

portugal.4.t:0 "The Parliament accuses the Communists"
portugal.4.d:0 "Paranoia grows again, as the parliamentaries were debating about the assassination, the rightists started declaring the communists responsible of this infamous act, with no evident proof, the interim chief of parliament ordered them to shut their mouth but still, they continued to say proudly that the whole left wing should be hanged before their "socialist contamination" spreads all across the governement. Shortly after, surely due to threat from the right wing, the centrists and all the democrat oppositions began to shout at the leftists, and now, it was the whole parliament accusing the commies, and with no one to stop them, they promptly forced the left opposition out of parliament, the "Partido Comunista Português" denounced this act as an "attempt against Portugal and It's population""
portugal.4.a:0 "I don't think this is very... "Democratic""

portugal.5.t:0 "Rolão Preto's speech"
portugal.5.d:0 "As the parliamentary crisis found no issue, the "Integralismo Lusitano" dropped some coal in the big fire. Their leader, the charismatic and young Rolão Preto, in front of the parliament, made a Furious speech about the degeneracy of the portuguese youths. And declared that they should be re-educated with the power of Christ to be sure that when the Brazilian Usurper will come, they would be met with fire and death. He continued for 10 minutes, shouting at the commies, the democrats and everybody suspected of potentially betraying the Monarchy. When he finnaly stopped, he was met with a torrent of Cheering from the right wing while the democrats were chocked and silencious"
portugal.5.a:0 "What a lovely speech" 

portugal.6.t:0 "The kings disbands his cabinet"
portugal.6.d:0 "What was supposed to happen happened, the king announced that his cabinet would be disolved and that he would choose a new one. Many people say he would continue on the status-quo, while another minority thinks he will gave the "Integralismo Lusitano" some seats. The democrats still think he could launch some reforms to permit the democratization of the political sphere, but for now, we wait."
portugal.6.a:0 "Disbanding a dead cabinet ? Interesting"
