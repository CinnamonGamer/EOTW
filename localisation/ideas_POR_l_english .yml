POR_Rebellingyouthidea_desc:0 "After the disastrous reign of Miguel II which caused "The Brazilians Hunt" the workingmen of Portugal united under the Banner of Socialism and Communism. The problem was ignored by the governement, and soon after, those "Trabalhadores socialistas" would begin forming their own Political Party. This new party promised "a true portuguese Utopia" which attracted the common plebs and particularly, the young students and then most of the lower classes. For now, the party isn't a real danger, it lacks basic organization and no one has been choosed to represent it, and they don't have any supports in the middle-class, giving them no chances to get actual funds, so for now, they only try to make strikes and refuse to enter the military."

POR_MilitaristicInfluenceidea_desc:0 "The portuguese political sphere his gangrened with old military men and militaristic politicans, the "Partido Monarquista Nacional" is one of the best exemple, being lead by Sidónio Pais, an old retired military man. The Portuguese's military is now insanely influtential and even a militarist, Óscar Carmona is friend with his majesty."

POR_TheyAreWatchingUsidea_desc:0 ""The Brazilians Hunt" which happened in 1923 left a big mark in Portuguese History. Most of the consequences of the "Hunt" were extremly bad, even disastrous. Althought, the educational reforms were quite succesful in teaching the youth, now, every Portuguese will tell you that the Brazilians are traitors, murderers and rapers. Every portugese is ready to defend it's country against the Brazilian threats, even if it means dying."
